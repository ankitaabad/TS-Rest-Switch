# TS Rest Switch

<div align="center"> <img src="icon.png"/></div>

- [ts-rest](https://ts-rest.com/)  lets you create type safe apis by defining contracts which can be implemented on server side and easily consumed on client side.
- This extension helps you to quickly switch between your API Contract definition and the Handler(implementation)
- From within a Contract or Handler run `TS Rest Switch` command to switch.
- The default keybinding is `CMD+T`. If it is already being used then you can change it.
